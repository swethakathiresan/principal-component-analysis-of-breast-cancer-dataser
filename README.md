ABOUT PCA


PCA generally tries to find the lower-dimensional surface to project the high-dimensional data.


Principal Component Analysis is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used for the dimensionality reduction in machine learning. It is a statistical process that converts the observations of correlated features into a set of linearly uncorrelated features with the help of orthogonal transformation. These new transformed features are called the PRINCIPAL COMPONENT. It is one of the popular tools that is used for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling. It is a technique to draw strong patterns from the given dataset by reducing the variances.



The PCA algorithm is based on some mathematical concepts such as:

->Variance and Covariance

->Eigenvalues and Eigen factors



Some common terms used in PCA algorithm:

-> Dimensionality

-> Correlation

-> Orthogonal

-> Eigenvectors

-> Covariance Matrix


Steps for PCA algorithm:

1. Getting the dataset
2. Representing data into a structure
3. Standardizing the data
4. Calculating the Covariance of Z
5. Calculating the Eigen Values and Eigen Vectors
6. Sorting the Eigen Vectors
7. Calculating the new features Or Principal Components
8. Remove less or unimportant features from the new dataset.


Applications of PCA:

-> PCA is mainly used as the dimensionality reduction technique in various AI applications such as computer vision, image compression, etc.

->It can also be used for finding hidden patterns if data has high dimensions. Some fields where PCA is used are Finance, data mining, Psychology, etc.
